####################################### performed sct and annotate for indiviual project (38 in total) in 2023Aug using all individual h5 file
refer to cellranger_record.sh

Note that: 
# 29Aug2023 found 10 h5 files from pool789 look suspicious (some files' sizes are very small; some of them were revealed to haven't been updated with the output generated on 
sars-gene-incorportaed barcode file)
# recopy the 10 h5 from original cellranger output folder in Sep6 2023, but accidently deleted all h5 in the origianl folder
# copy the original barcode files to Biowulf so that I can regenerate h5 file in the future (didn't copy the 2 from pool9, didn't recall why; in my impression, the h5 of them didn't give any trouble before)

For the allvirus object:
integrate from all individual rds which has been SCT and annotated before

starting from RNA assay
folowing Seurat's integration for large dataset cPCA instead of cca
re-annotate using integrated assay
however, didn't peform cluster (error out)

# issues encounterd during seuarat 20230831
# cann't perform clustering for the integrated object 
# allocating vector of size 230.2
# Error: vector memory exhausted (limit reached?)
#Error in unlist(object) :
